    "name": "Flat White",
    "description": "A flat white is a coffee drink that originated in Australia and New Zealand and has gained popularity worldwide. It is similar to a latte but has a higher ratio of coffee to milk, making it stronger and less milky. The flat white is made with a shot of espresso and steamed milk, with a thin layer of microfoam on top. This microfoam is created by steaming the milk to a creamy consistency, which blends seamlessly with the espresso, resulting in a velvety texture. The flat white’s flavor is robust, allowing the rich espresso to shine through while being mellowed by the creamy milk. It’s a favorite for those who enjoy a strong coffee taste but still appreciate the smoothness of milk. The flat white is typically served in a smaller cup than a latte, emphasizing its concentrated coffee flavor. The drink’s simplicity and elegance make it a staple in many specialty coffee shops.",

    "name": "Irish Coffee",
    "description": "Irish coffee is a decadent coffee cocktail that combines hot coffee, Irish whiskey, sugar, and a layer of cream on top. This drink is not only delicious but also has an interesting history. It was created in the 1940s by a chef named Joe Sheridan at the Foynes Airport in Ireland. The story goes that he wanted to create a warming drink for passengers arriving from transatlantic flights. Irish coffee became an instant hit and eventually made its way to the United States, where it gained even more popularity. The drink is typically made by combining freshly brewed coffee with a shot of Irish whiskey and a teaspoon of brown sugar, which adds a rich sweetness. The mixture is stirred until the sugar dissolves, and then a layer of lightly whipped cream is carefully poured over the back of a spoon to float on top. The result is a beautifully layered drink with a rich, warming flavor. The hot coffee and whiskey provide a comforting warmth, while the cream adds a smooth, velvety texture. Irish coffee is often enjoyed as a dessert or after-dinner drink, offering a perfect blend of coffee and whiskey flavors. It’s a delightful treat for those who enjoy a bit of indulgence with their coffee.",
